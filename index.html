	<p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The
		different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardised
		code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization. Often many individuals
		will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them
		all.[1] The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client
		side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader
		scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role
		involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>
